# April fool's day webpage

This is a fake mobile webpage that mimicking Apple's web design, in order to be look like official apple promotion page, written in Korean.

Please notice that there were either no profit, nor any kind of illegal attempts through this webpage. This webpage was only written for my sole educational, entertaining purpose. Code is written without any comments, and spaghetti-code-fashioned. ;p



## 'Get your Airpods FREE!!' 

This page introduces itself as Airpods Pro giveaway promotion page. To prank the user, it's workflow is written as follows:

1. Check the type of the browser. If it's desktop, it will say 'not supported'. Otherwise, it will transfer to the main page.
2. The user is expected to use Kakaotalk's integrated browser. It will display loading screen overlay for 3 seconds in order to fix the behavior of this site visited with current browser, which is is not working properly.
3. Display the promotion page looks pretty like Apple's promotion page. There is 2 buttons which are 'Order now', 'Learn more', but eventually will lead to the same prank page.
4. When the user pushes the button, it will redirect to the prank page, which will show South Korea's 'Naruto' meme famous during this period.
